## Explanation of N-tuple Network
In 2048, we have a 4x4 grid, 16 cells,  which is defined as board in our code. An n-tuple network, defined as pattern in our code, 
consists of n-tuples that covers n cells. If we construct a pattern as {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, it is a 6-tuple network which is shown below.

Each pattern has at most 8 type of isomorphic, i.e., 4 type of rotation (0째/90째/180째/270째) and 4 type of reflection and rotation. For example,

We evaluate the value of the given board state by summing up all the weights of the isomorphic n-tuple which are obtained by looking up a weight table, defined as feaure in our code.  
  
We choos the following 4 n-tuple network,  
{1, 5, 6}      , {0, 1, 2, 5}  
{0, 1, 2, 5, 9}, {4, 5, 8, 9, 10}
